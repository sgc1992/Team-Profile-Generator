# Team-Profile-Generator
We are creating Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, 
then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll
also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality
and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.
